### Press Release

SoFlow - an elegant app that puts all your social media in one place.

View, search and post across all your social accounts through one, all-encompassing app. Seamlessly connect to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr and SoundCloud.

SoFlow aims to create a unified social media experience for the avid content creator or anyone not looking to miss that game-changing tweet or controversial blog post.

In one simple feed, SoFlow allows you to view streams from your favourite social networks.

Share content across all of your social accounts from one intuitive window, without having to rewrite your post for each platform.

SoFlow's search pulls profiles and posts from all the social networks you are signed in with, along with SoundCloud tracks you can listen to in the background in a seamless, inbuilt player. 

It brings services from products such as Hootsuite and Buffer to the mainstream market at an accessible price for the average consumer.
